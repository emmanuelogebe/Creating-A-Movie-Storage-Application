Here are the tasks I intend to achieve:
- Allow the user to decide where to store movies
- Allow the user to decide the format of the movie
- Show the user the main interface and get their input
- Allow the user to add movies
- Show the user all the movies available
- Allow the user to find a movie
- Allow the user to decide when to terminate the program when satisfied by typing 'q'
